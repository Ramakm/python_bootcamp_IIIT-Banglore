#Steps

#TODO-1: - Create an empty List called display.
#For each letter in the chosen_word, add a "_" to 'display'.
#So if the chosen_word was "apple", display should be ["_", "_", "_", "_", "_"] with 5 "_" representing each letter to guess.

#TODO-2: - Loop through each position in the chosen_word;
#If the letter at that position matches 'guess' then reveal that letter in the display at that position.
#e.g. If the user guessed "p" and the chosen word was "apple", then display should be ["_", "p", "p", "_", "_"].

#TODO-3: - Print 'display' and you should see the guessed letter in the correct position and every other letter replace with "_".
#Hint - Don't worry about getting the user to guess the next letter. We'll tackle that in step 3.

#TODO-4: - Use a while loop to let the user guess again. The loop should only stop once the user has guessed all the letters in the chosen_word and 'display' has no more blanks ("_"). Then you can tell the user they've won.

#TODO-5: - If guess is not a letter in the chosen_word, Then reduce 'lives' by 1. If lives goes down to 0 then the game should stop and it should print "You lose."

#TODO-6: Join all the elements in the list and turn it into a String.

#TODO-7: Check if user has got all letters.

#TODO-8: - print the ASCII art from 'stages' that corresponds to the current number of 'lives' the user has remaining.
